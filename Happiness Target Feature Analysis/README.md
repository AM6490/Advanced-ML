Description:

This is a group project with two other classmates that analyzes different features in the world happiness index and how they influence the target feature happiness. 
We first conducted some EDA and feature engineering to make sure the model didn't encounter any hidden issues that we wouldn't have seen had we not taken a look at the data.

We then compared results of several models such as random forest classifiers and neural networks with different layers. 

We then used SHAP analysis to determine feature importance. 

One issue that is important to clarify is that many of the models, especially the NN models, were quite resource intensive, so workarounds should be considered in the future.

Cross-validation, train/test splits

AUC, precision/recall, confusion matrix

Hyperparameter tuning (grid/random search)
